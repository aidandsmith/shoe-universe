# Shoeniverse

**Shoeniverse** is a Jordan shoe e-commerce style website that dynamically loads product information using an external API. The project also integrates the Google Places Autocomplete API to validate and enhance the address input process, providing users with a smooth and interactive browsing and checkout experience.

## Project Objective

Creating a full website—encompassing design, implementation, and testing—is the primary goal of this assignment. Our team worked collaboratively to build a complete site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the integration of at least one external API that significantly enhances the functionality and user experience.
